# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project implements a *Machine Learning model using Linear Regression* to predict house prices based on key features such as *Area (sq ft)* and *Number of Bedrooms*. It is designed as part of a Python & ML internship task to demonstrate practical application of supervised learning.

## Objectives:
- Understand and implement Linear Regression  
- Perform data preprocessing and train-test splitting  
- Train a predictive machine learning model  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- Visualize actual vs predicted results  


## Features:
Loads and processes structured housing dataset  
Selects relevant input features  
Splits data into training and testing sets  
Trains a *Linear Regression model*  
Evaluates performance using:  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score  
Visualizes *Actual vs Predicted Prices* using a scatter plot
